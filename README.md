# RandomSpellEffect

This project provides randomly generated spell effects for use with various tabletop role-playing games.

These effects are intended to be used for Wild Magic Sorcerers, cursed objects, or any time you want to add some randomness and chaos to your game.

The app was inspired by "The Net Libram of Random Magical Effects" by Orrex and it uses some of its Chaos Bursts with permission of the author.

I'm currently working to support Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition and Savage World Adventure Edition.

The app is built in Android Studio using Kotlin. It is built using an MVP framework and implements Glide, Wasabeef's Glide Transformation Library, and PierfrancescoSoffritti's Android YouTube Player.
